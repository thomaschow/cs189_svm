Instructions to Run:

	ps1.m runs the necessary script to generate outputs for CS 189 problem set 1.
	
	In Matlab command line:

	[prob1, prob2, prob3] = ps1( TRAINING_DATA, TEST_DATA)
	
		TRAINING_DATA is the file path to the .m file for the training sets.
		TEST_DATA is the file path to the .m file for the test set.
		
	Output:
		The script generates 8 figures. The first is the error rate for problem 1. The next 7 are the confusion matrices for problem 2. 
		
		prob1 contains predicted_labels, accuracy, decisions/probability estimates.
		prob2 contains confusion matrices from prob1.
		prob3 contains the optimal value for C for an SVM, and the corresponding error rate on the test set.
		
		NOTE: output variables prob1 and prob2 can be ignored, as the figures will generate while running the script. 
			Navigate prob3 to find our answers to problem 3 on the pset.
